# Gelmaker Interface
This is the software for the server and interface of the Gelmaker, running on Raspberry Pi. It communicates with the Arduino through USB.
## Usage
Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system. From the project folder, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to start the development server. The interface can then be accessed on the local IP of the Raspberry Pi, on port 3000.
